# Fine-Tuning-DistilBERT-with-LoRA-for-Text-Classification
This project demonstrates fine-tuning a pre-trained DistilBERT model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for sentiment analysis on a truncated IMDb dataset. It leverages Hugging Face's transformers, peft, and datasets libraries to build an efficient text classification pipeline.
